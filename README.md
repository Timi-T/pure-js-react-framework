# 🛠️ JSX Tools: Parser + React-like Framework (Respond)

Welcome to the **JSX Tools** repository — a workspace containing two related projects:

1. 🧩 [`jsx-parser`](./jsx-parser) — A step-by-step, from-scratch JSX parser that converts JSX syntax into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and renders real DOM without using Babel or React.
2. ⚛️ [`Respond`](./respond) — A lightweight **React-like UI framework** inspired by the internal structure of React, focused on building reusable components and managing reactive DOM rendering.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

This monorepo is designed to help developers **understand the inner workings of JSX, virtual DOMs, and UI libraries** by building everything from the ground up.

Whether you're curious about how JSX is tokenized and parsed, or you're ready to experiment with building your own frontend framework — this repo is a great place to dive in.

## 🧩 JSX Parser (`/jsx-parser`)

> Parse JSX code to tokens → Build an AST → Render real DOM

This educational project demonstrates how JSX works behind the scenes. No Babel, no magic — just raw JavaScript and browser APIs.

✅ Tokenizes JSX strings
✅ Builds an AST tree
✅ Handles props, expressions, and event listeners
✅ Recursively renders DOM nodes
✅ Zero dependencies

📖 [Read the JSX Parser Guide →](./jsx-parser/README.md)

## ⚛️ Respond Framework (`/respond`)

> A small-but-powerful React-like framework built from scratch

Inspired by React's architecture, `Respond` is an experiment in building:

- Reusable components using a declarative syntax
- Simple virtual DOM diffing and reconciliation
- Custom hooks and reactive state
- Manual control over rendering with fine-grained updates

🚧 **Still in early development.** Follow for updates and milestones.

📖 [Coming Soon: Respond Documentation](./respond)

## 🧠 Vision

This repo is a **learning-driven dev sandbox** — a place to:

- Understand frontend frameworks under the hood
- Build tools that demystify "magic" like JSX parsing and reconciliation
- Explore performance, state, and rendering behavior
- Eventually create a micro frontend library with real-world potential

---

## 📦 Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/jsx-tools.git
cd jsx-tools
````

You can then dive into each folder (`jsx-parser` or `Respond`) independently.
